            <p> Blockchain had initally been devised for the digital currency Bitcoin but there is many more uses for it. The current value is estimated to be around $112bn. According to Alex and Don Tapscott 
                ("Blockchain Revolution, 2016): "The blockchain is an incorruptible digital ledger of economic transactions that can be programmed to record not just financial transactions but virtually everything 
                of value.” In terms of the words “block” and “chain”, the block is all the digital information, and the chain is the public database. Bitcoin has existed since 2008, and has worked for the most part
                without any issue, any issues were mainly due to hacking or mismanagement, meaning there is basically no flaws in the system,making it very robust and durable. <br>
                "Blocks" on the blockchain are made up of digital pieces of information.<br>
                1. Blocks store information on transactions eg. date, time and amount <br> 
                2. Instead of using your actual name, your purchase is recorded without any identifying information using a unique “digital signature,” sort of like a username. <br>
                3. Information is stored with a unique code called a hash to distinguish one block from another.

                <p> Autonomous Things were named as one of Gartner's 2019 tech trends. Autonomous robots are intelligent machines capable of independently performing tasks without human intervention. A classic example 
                    is Roombas, the robot vacuum cleaners. According to WayPoint Robotics; "A truly autonomous robot is one that can perceive its environment, make decisions based on what it perceives and/or has been 
                    programmed to recognise and then actuate a movement or manipulation within that environment." Flying robots (drones) are often used to explore areas inaccessible to humans, and have caused some trouble
                    of late. In December 2018, a drone invaded the airspace at Gatwick Airport and caused hundreds of flights to be cancelled over 3 days. The same happened again in early January 2019 in London Heathrow 
                    and departures were temporarily disrupted. <a href="https://waypointrobotics.com"> Way Point Robotics </a> explains why Roombas are real autonomous robots. "The Roomba is 
                    easily the most prolific, truly autonomous robot on the market today. While costing only a few hundred dollars, the Roomba is capable of making decisions and taking action based on what it perceives in 
                    its environment. It can be placed in a room, left alone, and it will do its job without any help or supervision from a person." <br> 
                    There are three crucial components to Autonomous Robots, perception, decision, and actuation. <br>

            <!-- Information taken from http://www.brandquarterly.com/power-immersive-experiences -->
            <p> According to <a href ="https://www.qualcomm.com/invention/cognitive-technologies/immersive-experiences" />Qualcomm</a> "The three pillars of immersive experiences are visual quality, sound quality, and intuitive 
                interactions. Full immersion can only be achieved by simultaneously focusing on these pillars." There are many kinds of immersive experience, but the 3 most popular kinds tend to be Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual 
                Reality (VR) and Mixed Reality (MR). AR is a layer over our own real world, VR is a step into a different world and MR is a hybrid of AR and VR. "Mixed Reality is a mix of virtual and holographic imagery, using glasses. 
                It’s a group or shared experience, and most people are talking about Magic Leap in this area – a US startup company that is working on a head-mounted virtual retinal display which superimposes 3D computer-generated imagery 
                over real-world objects." The three building blocks of Immersive Experience are: Story, Multi-Sensory and Flow. It is important for designers to create a memorable story for the user, and the way the story is depicted relates
                to how memorable to experience will be. As with any story, the senses need to be stimulated. In situations like immersive experience, our brains are easily manipulated and therefore to really heighten a user's experience, 
                it is important to appeal to all of the senses. "Flow is the state that people get into when they’re so engaged in a process or experience that the world starts to fall away. Creating a state of flow is made up of five key 
                principles: being able to communicate a clear goal; the goal must have a strong sense of purpose; giving people a sense of ownership and control over their decisions; knowing what you need to do; and knowing what you can 
                and can’t do. Most important is ensuring that experiences are designed to have the right balance of difficulty. Too difficult, and people will become frustrated. Too easy, and people will become bored." </p>
