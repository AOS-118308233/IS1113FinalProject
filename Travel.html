            <p> San Francisco is located on the West Coast of the United States of America at the north end of the San Francisco Peninsula. Several islands, including Alcatraz, Treasure Island, Yerba Buena Island and small portions of Alameda Island, Red Rock Island and Angel Island are part of San Francisco.
                Much of San Francisco city is on hills, with many of the neighborhoods being named after the hills on which they lie including Nob Hill, Russian Hill and Potrero Hill. One of the most famous hills is Twin Peaks, a popular lookout area for many locals and tourists. <br> The San Andreas and Hayward 
                Faults are known for causing much of the earthquake activity in the area. <br> The historic center of San Francisco is located in the northeast quadrant of the city, where the Financial District and Union Square (the main shopping and hotel district) is also located. Chinatown is also located near 
                the area, and is the oldest in North America. </p>

        <h2> Top Tourist Attractions </h2>
        
        <div style = "width: 85%;">
            <ol>
                <li><em><b> Golden Gate Bridge </b></em></li>
                The Golden Gate Bridge is easily the most popular tourist attractions in San Francisco. The bridge connects San Francisco to Marin County and other districts in the north. The bridge took four years to build and was open in May 1937, and at two miles long, it was the longest man-made suspension bridge. 
                It is one of the most photographed areas in the city and it accessible to pedestrians and cyclists who want to get a better look. <br>
                
                <li><em><b>  Alcatraz Island </b></em></li>
                One of America's most famous prisons, Alcatraz, is located on Alcatraz Island in the San Francisco Bay. Some of the most famous criminals were once housed here, such as Al Capone and "Birdman" until the prison was closed in 1963. It reopened 10 years later as a tourist attraction. Tourists can take a ferry
                over to the island for a tour of the prison, as well as listening to an audio recording about life in the prison, with narration coming from former guards and prisoners.  <br> 
            
                <li><em><b>  Cable Cars </b></em></li>
                The cable cars were first introduced in 1873 to help the locals to travel around the hilly districts of San Francisco. There are a few remaining cable cars for visitors to check out and travel around the city. The most scenic routes include the Powell-Mason and Powell-Hyde. The cable cars will get you to 
                attractions such as Fisherman's Wharf, the Ferry Building, Nob Hill and Lombard Street. 
                
                
                <li><em><b>  Chinatown </b></em></li>
                Chinatown in San Francisco is the largest of it's kind outside of Asia and the oldest in North America. Chinatown was almost completely destroyed during the 1906 earthquake, and was completely rebuilt in the Chinese style and was even more attractive than before. Today, you can expect to find temples, theatres, 
                antique and souvenir stores and teahouses. Chinese New Year celebrations here are considered to be the best in North America. 
                
                <li><em><b>  Twin Peaks </b></em></li>
                Twin Peaks are the only two remaining uninhabited hills in San Francisco and unlike the rest, they remain in their original state. Despite not being the tallest of San Francisco's hills, it has some of the most beautiful views of the bay and of the city.
